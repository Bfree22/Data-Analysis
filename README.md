# Data Analysis

* Playing with datasets using Pandas


* Import Pandas
  ```
  import pandas as pd
  ```



### This repo contains datasets from a variety of industries. I have used the Pandas library to clean, slice, and analyze the following results based on the selected requirements. I will be using the following functions to dissect and reorganize the data accordingly:


* pd.read_csv
* pd.dropna()
* pd.groupby()
* pd.mean()
* pd.max()
* pd.min()
* pd.DataFrame()
* pd.concat()
* pd.merge()



### Using the libraries above, I was able to read the csv file into my Jupyter file and begin creating the dataframe.
